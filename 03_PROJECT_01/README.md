# Portfolio Website - Bigyan Sapkota

A simple and clean portfolio website showcasing my projects, education, skills, and contact information. This project demonstrates fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to create a visually appealing and functional website.

## Key Concepts Explored

### 1. Design Thinking

- Applied design thinking principles to structure and organize content.
- Focused on creating a user-friendly layout and smooth navigation experience.

### 2. HTML Fundamentals

- Utilized **HTML entities** to display special characters and symbols where needed.
- Implemented **inline** and **block-level elements** effectively to structure content.
- Leveraged semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better readability and accessibility.
- Employed `<a>` (anchor) tags for seamless navigation between pages across the website.

### 3. Semantic Structure

- Used **semantic tags** to improve HTML5 document structure, making it more meaningful and accessible.
- Organized content into sections using `<section>` tags and grouped similar items within `<div>` elements.
- Created structured lists with `<dl>`, `<dd>`, and `<dt>` tags to display educational background in an organized manner.

### 4. Form Elements

- Integrated `<input>` tags within forms for user interaction and data collection.

### 5. CSS & JavaScript Integration

- Linked external **CSS** and **JavaScript** files to separate design and functionality from HTML content.
- Experimented with **inline styles** for quick customizations where needed, while keeping most styles in a dedicated stylesheet.
- **Basic DOM Manipulation**: Used JavaScript to dynamically display the current year in the footer using the DOM.

### 6. Additional Tags and Elements

- Used `<meter>` tags to visually represent skill levels in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Added a **contact button** that redirects to the contact page for easy communication.
